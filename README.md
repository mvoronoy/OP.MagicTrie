# OP.MagicTrie

## Persisted Trie generic container

The goal of project is to give C++ developers very fast key-value container based on ![Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie). 
One of the wonderful thing about Trie that complexity for most operations to find, insert, erase and update estimated as `O(m)`, where m is a length of used key. 
This project gives ability to developer to store key-value pairs in transacted way in huge storage on the disk.

# Planned features:
-Nearest release 0.1 to introduce Trie container;
- Series of articles with common title “Magic of Trie” to explain different techniques and algorithms to process big amount of information with help of Tries.
